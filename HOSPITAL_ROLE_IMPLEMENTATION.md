# Hospital Role Implementation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully added a new "Hospital" role to the Node.js + Express + MongoDB healthcare system. The implementation includes role-based access control, user management APIs, hospital management, and email notifications.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria - ALL COMPLETED

### 1. ‚úÖ Hospital Role Added
- **User Model**: Updated `models/User.js` to include 'hospital' in role enum
- **Auth Routes**: Updated Swagger docs in `routes/authRoutes.js` to reflect new role
- **RBAC Middleware**: Existing `restrictTo()` middleware supports hospital role

### 2. ‚úÖ Hospital Model Enhanced
- **Updated `models/Hospital.js`** with:
  - `userId` reference to User model
  - `isApproved` field (default: false)
  - Enhanced contact fields (phone, email required)
  - `services` enum with healthcare specialties
  - `workingHours` object
  - `departments` array reference
  - Proper timestamps and validation

### 3. ‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full system control (create/update/delete hospitals, approve/reject, manage all users)
- **Hospital**: Can update only their own hospital profile, manage their departments/doctors
- **Doctor**: Manage own profile, view assigned patients/appointments
- **Patient**: View/update own profile, book appointments, view own records

### 4. ‚úÖ User Management APIs Created
- **GET /api/users** (Admin only) - List all users with pagination and filters
- **GET /api/users/:id** (Admin or owner) - Get user details with role info
- **PUT /api/users/:id/role** (Admin only) - Update user's role with email notification
- **PUT /api/users/:id/profile** (Owner only) - User updates own profile
- **DELETE /api/users/:id** (Admin only) - Deactivate user

### 5. ‚úÖ Hospital Management APIs Enhanced
- **GET /api/hospitals** - List hospitals (Hospital role sees only their own)
- **POST /api/hospitals** - Create hospital (Admin: approved by default, Hospital: requires approval)
- **GET /api/hospitals/:id** - Get hospital details with proper permissions
- **PUT /api/hospitals/:id** - Update hospital (Admin or hospital owner)
- **PATCH /api/hospitals/:id/approve** - Approve/reject hospital (Admin only)

### 6. ‚úÖ Email Notifications Implemented
- **Role Change Email**: Sent when admin updates user's role
- **Hospital Approval Email**: Sent when admin approves/rejects hospital
- **Templates**: Added to `services/emailService.js` with proper HTML formatting

### 7. ‚úÖ Swagger Documentation Complete
- All new routes documented with:
  - Request/response schemas
  - Role restrictions clearly noted
  - Example JSON payloads
  - Proper parameter definitions

### 8. ‚úÖ Server Configuration Updated
- **Routes Mounted**: Added `/api/users` and `/api/hospitals` to `server.js`
- **Imports**: Added new route files to server imports
- **CORS**: Existing configuration maintained

## üîÑ Updated Route Permissions

### Department Routes
- **Create Department**: Now `restrictTo('admin', 'hospital')`
- Hospital users can create departments for their own hospital

### Doctor Routes  
- **Create Doctor**: Now `restrictTo('admin', 'hospital')`
- **Delete Doctor**: Now `restrictTo('admin', 'hospital')`
- Hospital users can manage doctors in their hospital

## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `controllers/userController.js` - User management logic
- `routes/userRoutes.js` - User management endpoints
- `routes/hospitalRoutes.js` - Hospital management endpoints

### Modified Files:
- `models/User.js` - Added 'hospital' to role enum
- `models/Hospital.js` - Enhanced schema with userId, isApproved, validation
- `controllers/hospitalController.js` - Complete rewrite with proper RBAC
- `services/emailService.js` - Added role change and hospital approval emails
- `routes/authRoutes.js` - Updated Swagger docs for new role
- `routes/departmentRoutes.js` - Updated permissions for hospital role
- `routes/doctorRoutes.js` - Updated permissions for hospital role
- `server.js` - Added new route mounts

## üéØ Response Format Standardized
All endpoints now return consistent format:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "message": string,
  "data": object | null
}
```

## üîê Security Implementation
- Hospital users can only access their own data
- Proper validation and authorization checks
- Admin retains full system control
- Email notifications for sensitive operations

## üöÄ Ready for Testing
The system is now ready with the Hospital role fully integrated. All acceptance criteria have been met while preserving existing functionality.

### Test Scenarios:
1. Create hospital user account
2. Admin approves/rejects hospital
3. Hospital user manages their profile
4. Hospital user creates departments
5. Hospital user adds doctors
6. Role change notifications work
7. Permission boundaries enforced

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Existing auth system preserved (no regeneration)
- MongoDB + Express + Mongoose stack maintained
- All existing endpoints remain functional
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Email service requires SMTP configuration
