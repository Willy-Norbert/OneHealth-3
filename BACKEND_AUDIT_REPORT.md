# Hospital Management System Backend Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive audit and enhancement of Node.js + MongoDB backend for hospital management system. This report identifies gaps, implements missing functionality, and provides complete integration guidance.

## Current System Analysis

### ✅ EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
- User management with 4 roles (patient, doctor, admin, hospital)
- Hospital CRUD operations with approval workflow
- Doctor management linked to hospitals/departments
- Department management system
- Appointment booking with slot locking mechanism
- JWT-based authentication and basic authorization
- Email notifications and Jitsi integration
- Swagger API documentation

### ❌ CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

#### 1. Hospital Role Access Control Issues
- **Missing**: Hospital-specific patient access endpoints
- **Missing**: Hospital can't easily retrieve only their patients
- **Missing**: Hospital can't manage their own doctors effectively
- **Missing**: Hospital-specific appointment management
- **Issue**: Hospitals can access all appointments instead of just their own

#### 2. Missing Core Hospital Features
- **Missing**: Ability for hospitals to create doctors for their departments
- **Missing**: Patient information retrieval at booking time
- **Missing**: Appointment reassignment to different doctors
- **Missing**: Hospital dashboard data endpoints
- **Missing**: Patient medical records integration

#### 3. Database Relationship Issues
- **Issue**: No direct Patient model (using User model)
- **Issue**: Appointments don't properly link to doctors
- **Issue**: Missing patient profile information
- **Issue**: Incomplete medical records integration

#### 4. Seed Data Limitations
- **Missing**: Sample appointments/bookings
- **Missing**: Realistic patient-hospital relationships
- **Missing**: Medical records sample data
- **Issue**: No demonstration of hospital workflow

#### 5. Security & Access Control
- **Issue**: Insufficient role-based access control
- **Issue**: Hospitals can access other hospitals' data
- **Issue**: Missing field-level authorization
